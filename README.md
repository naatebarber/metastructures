Learning substrates I think of

### ForceGeodesic

Differentiable learning system where nodes are bound to the surface of a hypersphere. When data arrives, it is split between the nodes by
the first set of weights `w_a`. The nodes then use this energy to apply force to each other using the second set of learnable weights `w_k`.

Force is applied tangentially across the surface of the hypersphere. Interesting dynamics potentially.
